    Values for the property. Multiple values per property are interpreted as an OR operation.
    Optionally one of these operations `=,!,!=,>,>=,<,<=` can be included at the begining of the value.
    By default the equality operation is used. 
    The values available for datetime fields (Ex: `created`, `startedAt`) are `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month` and `year`.
    Property `kind`, if included in the filter, will be matched using a case-insensitive comparison.
    For example, `kind:Pod` and `kind:pod` will bring up all pods. This is to maintain compatibility with Search V1.
